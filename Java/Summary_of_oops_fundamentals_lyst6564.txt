class --> blue print

Object --> Instance 

Creation of Object --> Instantiation

new --> used to create object

Object --> Memory allocated inside Heap area

Instance variable --
  -> Created directly within a class
  -> Memory allocated inside heap(Within object)
  -> Default values are assigned
  -> Can be acccessed any where within class also outside class using obj ref if not private
  -> 

Local Variables --
 -> Created inside class within a method or loop or a block or constructor
 -> Memory is alloacted inside stack area
 -> Default values are not assigned 
 -> Can be accessed only withina method or block where ever they are defined. Scope is local

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->If we create object/instance memory is alloacted in Heap area.
-->If there is no refrence referring to object inside heap area then Garbage collector would collect the object
(In other words object memory is de allocated)

--> When ever we call a method or a block to execute then one stack will be created within stack atrea
---> when ever that method body or block body execution is over that stack will be deallocated from stack area
 
We can write methods in Java in four diffrent ways based on needs refer class board notes for same;
